I'm Marco, 25 years old guy from Brescia, Italy.  
I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Bending Spoons](https://github.com/BendingSpoons).  
Here I'm busy creating some of the most beloved video and photo editors on the App Store.

Previously I was a a Master's student in Computer Engineering.
